# Mapping with ArcGIS Pro
This is the code repository for [Mapping with ArcGIS Pro](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mapping-arcgis-pro?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788298001), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
ArcGIS Pro is a geographic information system for working with maps and geographic information. This book will help you create visually stunning maps that increase the legibility of the stories being mapped and introduce visual and design concepts into a traditionally scientific, data-driven process.

The book begins by outlining the steps of gathering data from authoritative sources and lays out the workflow of creating a great map. You will learn to organize layers of information in ArcGIS Pro and identify the steps involved in streamlining the production process. Then, you'll learn how to use ArcGIS Pro's built in tools to organize the page structure and create custom colors and symbols. You will be then exposed to the techniques required to shape your data in specific size and scale required for our map. The later chapters will help you understand the various projection systems, trade offs between them, and create your own icons with a consistent design. Finally, you will be introduced to Smart Mapping, a new capability of ArcGIS that will help you to make maps that are visually stunning and useful.

By the end of this book, you will feel more confident in making appropriate cartographic decisions.
